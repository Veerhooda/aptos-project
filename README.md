# Quiz Badges Smart Contract  

## 📌 Title  
Accumulate Quiz Badges to Unlock Credit-Bearing Assessments  

## 📖 Description  
This smart contract, written in Move for the Aptos blockchain, allows students to accumulate **quiz badges** through their learning journey. Once a student reaches a set threshold of badges, they automatically unlock **credit-bearing assessments**.  

The contract contains two simple functions:  
- **register_student** → Initializes a student's progress record.  
- **earn_badge** → Adds a quiz badge to the student's account and unlocks credits if the badge threshold is met.  

## 🌍 Vision  
To build a transparent and decentralized academic progression system where students are rewarded for consistent learning efforts. The system ensures fairness by recording achievements on-chain and offering verifiable access to credit-bearing assessments.  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- Add a **view function** for students to check their progress.  
- Integrate with **NFT badges** for better recognition and ownership.  
- Support **multi-course thresholds**, where different credit modules can be unlocked.  
- Link to **decentralized identity systems** for academic verification.  
- Enable **institutions to customize thresholds** for different assessments.
